# Terraform Associate Study Guide

This is a study guide I made to help me, and hopefully others, study for the Hashicorp's Terraform Associate exam.

## These are some details about the exam

* Price: 70.50 USD (as of September 2020)
* Duration: 1 hour
* Language: English
* Assessment type: Multiple choice
* Expiration: 2 years

[This is the official study guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-study).

Besides the study guide from Hashicorp, I'd recommend buying the [Hashicorp Terraform Certified Associate Preparation Guide](https://leanpub.com/terraform-certified). It's a great book!

If you're after a free course, [check this one by Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

For this study guide, I also put the confidence level cell, like the one for AZ-104. You can rate your knowledge in a specific area, for later referral.

I hope you find useful. Please feel free to add, or change anything.
